# Wrap-up

## Modeling, and Stan

1. How well a statistical method works depends on the situation.

2. We can describe the "situation" with a *probability model*.

3. Inference usually works best if the probabilistic model reflects reality .

4. Explicit models make it easy to simulate, and therefore test your methods.

5. Stan lets you do inference using (almost) arbitrary models.

## Hierarchical Bayesian models

1. It is often possible to infer things about *populations* that we can't infer about individuals.

2. Doing so leads to *sharing of information* (or, "power") between samples,
   and can improve accuracy.

3. Priors (and hyperpriors) on individual parameters provides a good way to do this.

# Identify the GLM

## Which response distribution for the GLM?

1. How number of pumpkins per vine
   depends on fertilizer and water amount.

2. How distance from home to workplace is predicted by
   income, job category, and city.

3. How (presence or absence of) hip dysplasia in dogs
   depends on age and breed.

4. How doughnut weight varies between and within bakeries and doughnut types.

5. How house prices are predicted by elevation, distance to stores,
   and square footage.

*Options:* normal / binomial / poisson / gamma / cauchy
