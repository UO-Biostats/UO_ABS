## Proportional Hazards

*Goal:* understand how covariates affect survival time.

. . .

*Idea:* modify a nonparametric hazard rate
by a linear predictor:
$$ h(t) = h_0(t) e^{\beta x} .$$

. . .

```{r plotcoxph, echo=FALSE}
layout(t(1:2))
plot(survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data=lung), col=1:2, main='Kaplan-Meier', xlab='days')
plot(survfit(coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data=lung),
              newdata=data.frame(sex=c(1,2))), col=1:2, main='Cox Proportional Hazards', xlab='days')
legend('topright', lty=1, col=1:2, legend=c("male", "female"))

## Fitting a Cox model

```{r fitcox}
fullcox <- coxph(Surv(time, status)
                     ~ age + sex + ph.ecog + ph.karno + pat.karno
                     + meal.cal + wt.loss,
                 data = lung)
summary(fullcox)
```

## Model comparison

```{r anova}
subcox <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + ph.ecog, data = lung, subset=rowSums(is.na(lung[,2:10]))==0)
anova(fullcox, subcox)
```

## Predictions

```{r prediction}
subcox_pred <- survfit(subcox, newdata=expand.grid(ph.ecog=0:3, sex=2))
plot(subcox_pred, lty=1, col=1:4, main='predicted survival, females')
legend("topright", lty=1, col=1:4, legend=paste("ECOG=", 0:3))
```


## In class

Interpretation:

- describe the data
- explain and explore the results
- interpret conclusions.

## Describe the data

We have survival time data for 228 lung cancer patients,
of whom 90 are female and 138 are male.
Most of the patients are between 55 and 75 years old,
and the extremes are 39 and 82 years old.
The median survival time was around 1-1.5 years,
with females having around 20% longer survival times.
The longest-living pateients lived for (at least) three years.
*Note: explain variables also.*

## Describe the covariates

```{r plotit}
pairs(as.data.frame(sapply(lung[c("age", "ph.ecog", "ph.karno", "pat.karno")], jitter)), col=lung$sex, pch=20)
```

The ECOG scores and Karnoffsky scores
*(say something about the ranges of these)*.

The physician- and patient-assigned Karnofsky scores were
positively correlated ($r=0.5$),
and were negatively correlated with ECOG score ($r=-0.8$ for physician-assigned).
These were not strongly correlated with age.

## Results

We fit a Cox proportional hazards model (...)
The covariates that most strongly predicted survival
were sex and ECOG score, and both were strongly statistically significant.
Females were predicted to have about a 15% higher surivival probability
at one year (*todo: get precise number*).
Lower ECOG scores (ie, better patient health at initial diagnosis)
predicted higher survival, with a 30% survival for ECOG 3
to 80% survival for ECOG 0.
The difference between ECOG scores was larger than between sexes.

## 

TODO: say something about uncertainty in estimates.

TODO: re-fit with ECOG as a factor, and compare

TODO: figure out why Karnofsky score is going the opposite direction

```{r only_karno}
only_karno <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + ph.karno, data = lung)
summary(only_karno)
