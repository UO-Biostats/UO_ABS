# Tidy data

## Checklist for data tidiness

- Store a copy of data in a nonproprietary format, (e.g. plain ASCII text)
- Leave an uncorrected file when doing analyses
- Use descriptive names for your data files and variables
- Include a header line with descriptive variable names
- Maintain effective metadata about the data (a README)
- Add new observations to a dataset by *row*
- Add new variables to a dataset by *column*
- A column of data should contain only one data type
- All measurements of the same type should be in the same column

## Exercise

::: {.columns}
::::::: {.column width=50%}

Design a tidy data format for the stickleback experiment:
two strains of stickleback were made microbe free,
placed in tanks and either innoculated with microbes or not,
then had their gene expression measured with RNA-seq.
Sex is recorded, also.

## Tools for tidy data

Tidying data is *hard*!

. . .

... and often requires expert input.

. . .

Many common *data wrangling* operations
are made easier by the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org).

## The "tidyverse"


- packages that do many of the same things as base functions in R

- designed to do them more "cleanly"

- also includes `ggplot` (for "Grammar of Graphics")

## Key functions in dplyr

- Pick observations by their values with `filter()`.
- Reorder the rows with `arrange()`.
- Pick variables by their names with `select()`.
- Create new variables with functions of existing variables with `mutate()`.
- Collapse many values down to a single summary with `summarise()`.

## `filter()`, `arrange()` and `select()`

```
a1 <- select(airbnb, neighbourhood, price, host_id, beds, bathrooms)
```

```
a2 <- filter(a1, neighbourhood == "Richmond" 
                 | neighbourhood == "Woodlawn"
                 | neighbourhood == "Downtown")
```

```
a3 <- arrange(a2, price, neighbourhood)
```

## Also, the "pipe"

```
a3 <- (select(airbnb, neighbourhood, price, host_id, beds, bathrooms)
        %>% filter(neighbourhood == "Richmond" 
                     | neighbourhood == "Woodlawn"
                     | neighbourhood == "Downtown")
        %>% arrange(price, neighbourhood))
```

## 

Tidyverse:
```
a3 <- (select(airbnb, neighbourhood, price, host_id, beds, bathrooms)
        %>% filter(neighbourhood == "Richmond" 
                     | neighbourhood == "Woodlawn"
                     | neighbourhood == "Downtown")
        %>% arrange(price, neighbourhood))
```

. . .

Base:
```
a1 <- airbnb[,c("neighbourhood", "price", "host_id", "beds", "bathrooms")]
a2 <- subset(a1, neighbourhood %in% c("Richmond", "Woodlawn", "Downtown"))
a3 <- a2[order(a2$price, a2$price), ]
```


## `mutate()` and `transmutate()`

Add new variables:
```
mutate(a3,
    price_per_bed = price / beds,
    price_per_bath = price / bathrooms)
```
Or, make an entirely new data frame:
```
transmute(airbnb,
    price = price,
    price_per_bed = price / beds,
    price_per_bath = price / bathrooms)
```

## `group_by()` and `summarize()`

`group_by()` aggregates data by category, e.g.:
```
by_hood <- group_by(a3, neighbourhood)
```
Now, you can calculate *summaries* of other variables *within* each group, e.g.:
```
summarise(by_hood, price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Your turn

1. Make a data frame only including rooms in the top ten neighbourhoods.
    Then, using only these neighbourhoods...

2. Find the mean `price`, `cleaning_fee`, and ratio of cleaning fee to price, by neighbourhood.

3. Edit your code in (2) to add variables for the 25% and 75% quantile of `price` (use `quantile( )`).

4. Do as in (2) and (3) but splitting by both `neighbourhood` and `room_type`
   (e.g., finding the mean price of private rooms in Woodlawn).

5. Edit your code in (1) to add a new variable giving the number of characters in the `house_rules` (use `nchar( )`).
