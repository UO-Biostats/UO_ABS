## Steps in data analysis

1. Care, or at least think, about the data.

2. Look at the data.

3. Query the data.

4. Check the results.

5. Communicate.

. . .

Often "statistics" focuses on *querying*.
Doing that effectively requires all the other steps, too.


## Prerequisites

We'll be assuming that you have some familiarity with

- programming, and
- statistics

. . .

For instance, you should be able to figure out what this means:
```{r intro}
x = c(2, 4, 3, 6)
y = c(5, 12, 4, 10, 2)
t.test(x, y)
```


## Overview and mechanics

See [the course website](https://UO-Biostats.github.io/UO_ABS).

Questions?

# Some core statistical concepts

## Statistics or parameters?

A **statistic** is

: a numerical description of a dataset.

. . .

A **parameter** is 

: a numerical attribute of a model of reality.

. . .

Often, *statistics* are used to estimate *parameters*.


## The two heads of classical statistics

estimating parameters, with uncertainty *(confidence intervals)*

evaluating (in-)consistency with a particular situation *($p$-values)*

. . .

1. What do these data tell us about the world?
2. How strongly do we believe it?


. . .

*This week:* digging in, with simple examples.


## Lurking, behind everything:

is *uncertainty*

. . .

thanks to *randomness*.

. . .

How do we understand randomness, concretely and quantitatively?

. . .

With *models*.



# A quick look at some data

## Some data

AirBnB hosts in Portland, OR:
[website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) and 
[download link](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/or/portland/2019-07-10/data/listings.csv.gz).

```{r airbnb}
airbnb <- read.csv("../Datasets/portland-airbnb-listings.csv")
nrow(airbnb)
names(airbnb)
```

##


Questions: how much does an AirBnB typically cost in Portland?
Do "instant bookable" ones cost more?


## Second, look at the data

```{r airbnb_numbers}
summary(airbnb$price)
```

## 

```{r airbnb_ib}
summary(airbnb$instant_bookable)
```

## Whoops

```{r airbnb_data}
airbnb$price <- as.numeric(gsub("$", "", airbnb$price, fixed=TRUE))
airbnb$instant_bookable <- (airbnb$instant_bookable == "t")
```

------------

```{r airbnb_numbers2}
summary(airbnb$price)
summary(airbnb$instant_bookable)
```

------------

```{r bed}
table(airbnb$bed_type) # hm
```

## How much is a typical night?

```{r mean_price}
mean(airbnb$price, na.rm=TRUE)
```

-------------------

```{r airbnb_hist, fig.width=2.5*fig.dim}
hist(airbnb$price, breaks=40, xlab='nightly price ($)', col=grey(.8), xlim=range(airbnb$price, finite=TRUE), main='AirBnB prices in Portland, OR')
```

. . .

Conclusion?


## Do "instant bookable" charge more?

```{r airbnb_hist2, fig.height=1.5*fig.dim, fig.width=2.5*fig.dim}
layout(1:2)
instant <- airbnb$price[airbnb$instant_bookable]
not_instant <- airbnb$price[!airbnb$instant_bookable]
hist(not_instant, breaks=40, xlab='nightly price ($)', col=grey(.8), xlim=range(airbnb$price, finite=TRUE), main='not instant bookable') 
hist(instant, breaks=40, xlab='nightly price ($)', col=grey(.8), main='instant bookable')
```

--------------

```{r airbnb_t}
(tt <- t.test(instant, not_instant))
```

## Conclusion

> Instant bookable hosts cost more than others
> (P=`r format(tt$p.value, digits=2)`, t-test with df=`r tt$parameter`).

. . .

*Critique this conclusion, and write your own.*

*Scribe:* person with the smallest `sample.int(1000, 1)`.


## Don't forget Steps 1 and 5!

1. Care, or at least think, about the data.


5. Communicate.

. . .

How *big* is the difference? How sure are we?

. . .

Statistical significance does not imply real-world significance.



## Revised conclusion (in class)

Instant bookable hosts cost on average $10 more than
not instant bookable,
with a 95\% confidence interval
of $4.50 to $15.
The distribution of prices in the two groups were very similar:
for instance, the first and third quantiles of instant bookable hosts 
are $`r round(quantile(instant, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE), 0)`
and $`r round(quantile(instant, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE), 0)`,
and those of not instant bookable hosts
are $`r round(quantile(not_instant, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE), 0)`
and $`r round(quantile(not_instant, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE), 0)`,
respectively.
The average instant bookable cost was about $125, with a 95% 
confidence interval of +/- about $4;
non-instant bookable hosts cost on average $115 per night,
with a 95\% CI of about +/- $3.
Note that the difference of $10 is smallish compared
to the price of a room,
but the difference is highly significant (p=.0003, t-test with 5039 degrees of freedom)
because of the large sample sizes.

So: what did we just do?




# Hypothesis testing and $p$-values


## A $p$-value is

. . .

> the probability of seeing a result at least as surprising
> as what was observed in the data,
> if the null hypothesis is true.

. . .

Usually, this means

- *a result* - numerical value of a statistic
- *surprising* - big
- *null hypothesis* - the model we use to calculate the $p$-value

which can all be defined to suit the situation.

## What does a small $p$-value mean?

*If* the null hypothesis *were* true,
then you'd be really unlikely to see something like what you actually *did*.

. . .

So, either the "null hypothesis" is not a good description of reality
or something surprising happened.

. . .

How useful this is depends on the null hypothesis.


## For instance

```{r airbnb_t2, echo=FALSE}
tt
```

## Also for instance

```{r airbnb_t3}
t.test(airbnb$price)
```

. . .

Is *that* $p$-value useful?


## Exercise:

*My hypothesis:*
People tend to have longer index fingers on the hand they write with
because writing stretches the ligaments.

*(class survey)*
How many people have a longer index finger on the hand they write with?

. . .

*(class survey)*
Everyone flip a coin:
```
ifelse(runif(1) < 0.5, "H", "T")
```
and put the result in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bHHyvVaxZXrnN55Hpwhv55u9nbYDEHdC3jHXB5uOB6I/edit).

. . .

We want to estimate the parameter

$$\begin{equation}
    \theta = \P(\text{random person has writing finger longer}) ,
\end{equation}$$

and now we have a *fake dataset with $\theta = 1/2$*.


##

Let's get some more data:
```
n <- 37 # class size
sum(ifelse(runif(1) < 1/2, "H", "T") == "H")
```
and put the result in [the same google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bHHyvVaxZXrnN55Hpwhv55u9nbYDEHdC3jHXB5uOB6I/edit).

. . .

Now we can estimate the $p$-value for the hypothesis that $\theta = 1/2$.

##

A faster method:

```
replicate(1000, sum(rbinom(n, 1, 1/2) > 0))
```

. . .

or, equivalently,
```
rbinom(1000, n, 1/2)
```

## (in class)

```{r in_class_1}
mean(replicate(10000, rbinom(1, 36, 1/2) >= 20))
```

Here, we've estimated that the difference in numbers
of people with a longer finger on each hand is not statistically
significant ($p \appox 0.3$, by simulation).


## So, where do $p$-values come from?

Either math:

![table of p-values from a t distribution](images/t-table.png)

. . .

Or, computers. (maybe math, maybe simulation, maybe both)

##

So, where did *this* $p$-value come from?
```{r p_again}
(tt <- t.test(instant, not_instant))
```

. . .

The $t$ distribution!
