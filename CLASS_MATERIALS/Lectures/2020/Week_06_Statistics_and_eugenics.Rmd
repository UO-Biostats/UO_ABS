## Galton's science

```{r plot_galton, echo=FALSE, fig.width=2.0*fig.dim, fig.height=2.0*fig.dim}
galton <- read.table("../Datasets/galton/galton-all.tsv", header=TRUE)
gdiff <- diff(with(galton, tapply(height, gender, mean)))
galton$midparent <- (galton$mother + galton$father - gdiff)/2
galton$adj_height <- galton$height - (galton$gender == "M") * gdiff
plot(jitter(adj_height) ~ jitter(midparent), data=galton, asp=1, xlab="midparent", ylab="adjusted height", pch=20)
abline(0, 1, col='red', lwd=2)
abline(coef(lm(adj_height ~ midparent, data=galton)), col='blue', lwd=2)

## Karl Pearson and the Biometrics Laboratory

::: {.columns}
::::::: {.column width=50%}


- developed the correlation coefficient and the chi-squared test;
  early use of the $p$-value

- head of the first Department of Applied Statistics,
  as the Galton chair of Eugenics

- focus on "biometry": statistical theory of biological measurements,
    especially evolution and inheritance.

- had a lengthy feud with Udny Yule
    over the correct definition
    of the correlation coefficient for a $2\times 2$ table

# Some natural questions to ask

##

1. What's up with this connection to eugenics?

2. How can we reconcile these people being very smart about some things but not about others?

3. Has this history had an impact on how we do statistics?


# Eugenics?

> applies. [...] It was not a light
> task, but it gave for many years the raison d'etre of my statistical work.

- upper-class Nordic eugenicists thought that everyone except upper-class Nordic people
  were dangerously degenerate

- they opposed curing tuberculosis and justified the genocide of the Americas

- this inspired forced sterilization and anti-miscengenation laws in the US,
  targeting poor and people of color

- and this directly inspired the Nazis

PSA: eugenics is a bunch of bullshit


## Others

Bystanders:

- William Gosset ($t$-test): focused on practical applications

- Egon Pearson (hypothesis testing): pushed to separate statistics and eugenics departments

Opponents:

- Lancelot Hogben: biologist, opponent of eugenics

- Thomas Morgan: biologist, opponent of eugenics


# "Smart" people

## Pearson and tuberculosis

- caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis

- occurs more often among relatives

- major risk factors: silicosis (30x), malnutrition, smoking, alcoholism, crowding

- minor: genetics (mostly immune-related)

. . .

*Pearson:* it's hereditary!

## 

![The hereditary factor in pellagra](images/davenport-pellagra.png)

- niacin deficiency

- was common among poor Americans in the early 1900s

- ... since corn lacks niacin unless nixtamalized.

*Davenport:* it's hereditary!

## Fisher and smoking

::: {.columns}
::::::: {.column width=50%}

- *Hill & Doll:* retrospectively compare cancer rates between matched smoking/nonsmoking pairs

- *Hill & Doll:* prospectively compare cancer rates between smoking/nonsmoking doctors

- etcetera

- *Fisher:* Correlation is not causation. Let's calmly study this a while longer.

*what **is** being "smart", anyways?*

# Has this affected how we do statistics?

##

::: {.centered}

well, numbers aren't racist?

:::

. . .

::: {.centered}

but how we *use* them might be


:::


## So the argument goes:

$p$-values and hypothesis tests focus on *whether* there's a difference between groups,

. . .

... ignoring whether any difference is *important*.

. . .

This is a major problem with reflexive reporting of "statistical significance".

. . .

Is this because of "eugenics thinking"?

##

A small methodological fix:

. . .

:::{.centered}
the *confidence interval*

## More important than statistical technique:

- What questions are being asked?

- What data is being collected? (and how)

- What assumptions are being made?

- What are the important conclusions?


# In conclusion

## Looking forward

::: {.columns}
::::::: {.column width=70%}


Pearson & Fisher had a big impact in part because (they were pushy and)
they were working towards something.

Today we have many problems that we need quantitative work to solve.

**Where do you want to have an impact?**
