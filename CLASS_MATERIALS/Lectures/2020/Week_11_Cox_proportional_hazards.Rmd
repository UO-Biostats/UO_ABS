## Proportional Hazards

*Goal:* understand how covariates affect survival time.

. . .

*Idea:* modify a nonparametric hazard rate
by a linear predictor:
$$ h(t) = h_0(t) e^{\beta x} .$$

. . .

```{r plotcoxph, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3.0*fig.dim}
layout(t(1:2))
plot(survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data=lung), col=1:2, main='Kaplan-Meier')
plot(survfit(coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data=lung),
              newdata=data.frame(sex=c(1,2))), col=1:2, main='Cox Proportional Hazards')
legend('topright', lty=1, col=1:2, legend=c("male", "female"))

## Fitting a Cox model

```{r fitcox}
fullcox <- coxph(Surv(time, status)
                     ~ age + sex + ph.ecog + ph.karno + pat.karno
                     + meal.cal + wt.loss,
                 data = lung)
summary(fullcox)
```

## Model comparison

```{r anova}
subcox <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + ph.ecog, data = lung, subset=rowSums(is.na(lung[,2:10]))==0)
anova(fullcox, subcox)
```

## Predictions

```{r prediction}
subcox_pred <- survfit(subcox, newdata=expand.grid(ph.ecog=0:3, sex=2))
plot(subcox_pred, lty=1, col=1:4, main='predicted survival, females')
legend("topright", lty=1, col=1:4, legend=paste("ECOG=", 0:3))
```


## In class: interpretation

The data:

- 168 patients with 121 observed survival times, over 1000 days.
- (say more about the data)
- Few (maybe no?) patients survived 1000 days.
- Less than half survived to 50%.
- More than half of males who survived to 1 year died in the following year.
- Females more likely to survive longer than males: 20% higher survival rates until at least 800 days
- 50% of males have died by 1 year, while for females this is 1.5 years

------------

- Fitting a Cox's PH model, sex and ECOG score are strongly predictive of survival times,
  while other variables have a weak effect, if at all.
- ECOG and Karnofsky score are correlated, so ECOG seems to be the best predictor,
  with physician-reported Karnofsky score more reliable than patient-reported.

```{r correlation}
pairs(jitter(as.matrix(lung[,c("ph.ecog", "ph.karno", "pat.karno")])))
cor(lung[,c("ph.ecog", "ph.karno", "pat.karno")], use='pairwise')
```

-----------

Females tend to live longer: here are predicted survival curves for males and females
with all other variables set to their mean values.
There is a predicted difference in survivorship of around 20%;
the difference reflects that seen in the Kaplan-Meier curves above.

```{r prediction2}
mean_vals <- as.data.frame(lapply(lung[,c("age", "ph.ecog", "ph.karno", "pat.karno", "meal.cal", "wt.loss")], mean, na.rm=TRUE))
fullcox_sex <- survfit(fullcox,
                        newdata=cbind(mean_vals, sex=c(1, 2)))
plot(fullcox_sex, lty=1, col=1:4, main='predicted survival, mean values')
legend("topright", lty=1, col=1:4, legend=c("males", "females"))
```


-----------

Now, here are predicted survival curves for females, separately by ECOG score,
showing a huge difference by ECOG score:
survivorship ranges from about 10% for ECOG score 0 to 80% for ECOG score 3,
and around 40% of ECOG score 0 patients surviving past 1000 days.


```{r prediction3}
fullcox_ecog <- survfit(fullcox,
                        newdata=cbind(expand.grid(ph.ecog=0:3, sex=2),
                                      mean_vals[,-2]))
plot(fullcox_ecog, lty=1, col=1:4, main='predicted survival, females')
legend("topright", lty=1, col=1:4, legend=paste("ECOG=", 0:3))
```

-----------

In that model, we used *numerical* ECOG scores, assuming that the difference between
scores 1 and 2 was the same as that between 2 and 3. If we change ECOG to a factor,
we can see how well this holds up:
it looks like the difference between ECOG 2 and 3 is bigger than between 0 and 1,
although the predictions are not wildly different than in the simpler model.

```{r prediction4}
newcox <- coxph(Surv(time, status)
                     ~ age + sex + factor(ph.ecog) + ph.karno + pat.karno
                     + meal.cal + wt.loss,
                 data = lung)
newcox_ecog <- survfit(newcox,
                        newdata=cbind(expand.grid(ph.ecog=0:3, sex=2),
                                      mean_vals[,-2]))
plot(newcox_ecog, lty=1, col=1:4, main='predicted survival, females')
legend("topright", lty=1, col=1:4, legend=paste("ECOG=", 0:3))
```

---------

Indeed, using an ANOVA to compare the models,
we don't get a strong indication that allowing separate effects of each ECOG level
is making the model fit much better.

```{r compare_mods}
anova(fullcox, newcox)
```
