# Estimating sampling error

## Standard error

From a single set of numbers

$$ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n $$

we can get both a *mean*:

$$ \bar x = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i $$

. . .

**and** an estimate of the *variability* of the mean,
the *standard error*:

$$ \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_i - \bar x\right)^2 } .$$

This is amazing!

. . .

Sadly, most other types of estimates don't have this amazing property.

. . .

What to do?


# Enter the bootstrap

## 

**Idea:**

> - We'd *like* to get a whole new dataset,
>     and repeat the estimation, to see how different the answer is.
> 
> - And, well, our best guess at what the data look like
>   is **our dataset itself**,
> 
> - *sooooo,* let's just *resample from the dataset*, with replacement,
>   to make a "new" dataset!
> 
> - If we resample and re-estimate lots of times,
>   this should give us a good idea of the variability of the estimate.


## The bootstrap resampling algorithm

To estimate the uncertainty of an estimate:

1. Use the computer to take a random sample of observations
   from the original data, with replacement.

2. Calculate the estimate from the resampled data set.

3. Repeat 1-2 many times.

4. The standard deviation of these esimates is the **bootstrap standard error**.


## Advantages

- Applies to most any statistic

- Works when there's no simple formula for the standard error
  (e.g., median, trimmed mean, eigenvalue, etc)

- Is *nonparametric*, so doesn't make specific assumptions about the distribution of the data.

- Applies to even complicated sampling procedures.


## Exercise

```{r ex_data}
x <- c(0.6, 1, 3.1, 3.7, 4.8, 6.2, 12.5, 12.5, 13.4, 24.1)
```

- Use R to make 1000 "pseudo-samples" of size 10 (with replacement),

- and store the mean of each in a vector.

- Plot the histogram of the resampled means,
  and calculate their standard deviation (with `sd()`).

- How does this compare to the usual standard error of the mean,
  `sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))`?


## Confidence intervals?

The 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of the bootstrap samples
estimate a 95% confidence interval.
(use the `quantile( )` function)

. . .

*Exercise:* get a 95% CI and compare it to that given by `t.test( )`.
