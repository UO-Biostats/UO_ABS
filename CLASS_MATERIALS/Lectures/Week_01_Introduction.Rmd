## Steps in data analysis

1. Care, or at least think, about the data.

2. Look at the data.

3. Query the data.

4. Check the results.

5. Communicate.

. . .

Often "statistics" focuses on *querying*.
Doing that effectively requires all the other steps, too.


## Prerequisites

We'll be assuming that you have some familiarity with

- programming, and
- statistics

. . .

For instance, you should be able to figure out what this means:
```{r intro}
x = c(2, 4, 3, 6)
y = c(5, 12, 4, 10, 2)
t.test(x, y)
```


## Overview and mechanics

See [the course website](https://UO-Biostats.github.io/UO_ABS).

Please take 10 minutes to

1. answer the "Welcome Survey" on Canvas,
2. [get the course repository from github](https://uo-biostats.github.io/UO_ABS/pages/using-git.html),
3. [install Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and/or
4. move around.

Questions?

# Some core statistical concepts

## Statistics or parameters?

A **statistic** is

: a numerical description of a dataset.

. . .

A **parameter** is 

: a numerical attribute of a model of reality.

. . .

Often, *statistics* are used to estimate *parameters*.


## The two heads of classical statistics

estimating parameters, with uncertainty *(confidence intervals)*

evaluating (in-)consistency with a particular situation *($p$-values)*

. . .

1. What do these data tell us about the world?
2. How strongly do we believe it?


. . .

*This week:* digging in, with simple examples.


## Lurking, behind everything:

is *uncertainty*

. . .

thanks to *randomness*.

. . .

How do we understand randomness, concretely and quantitatively?

. . .

With *models*.



# A quick look at some data

## Some data

AirBnB hosts in Portland, OR:
[website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) and 
[download link](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/or/portland/2019-07-10/data/listings.csv.gz).

```{r airbnb}
airbnb <- read.csv("../Datasets/portland-airbnb-listings.csv")
nrow(airbnb)
names(airbnb)
```

##


Questions: how much does an AirBnB typically cost in Portland?
Do "instant bookable" ones cost more?


## Second, look at the data

```{r airbnb_numbers}
summary(airbnb$price)
str(airbnb$price)
```

## 

```{r airbnb_ib}
summary(airbnb$instant_bookable)
str(airbnb$instant_bookable)
```

## Whoops

```{r airbnb_data}
airbnb$price <- as.numeric(gsub("$", "", airbnb$price, fixed=TRUE))
airbnb$instant_bookable <- (airbnb$instant_bookable == "t")
```

------------

```{r airbnb_numbers2}
summary(airbnb$price)
summary(airbnb$instant_bookable)
```

------------

```{r bed}
table(airbnb$bed_type) # hm
```

## How much is a typical night?

```{r mean_price}
mean(airbnb$price, na.rm=TRUE)
```

-------------------

```{r airbnb_hist, fig.width=2.5*fig.dim}
hist(airbnb$price, breaks=40, xlab='nightly price ($)', col=grey(.8), xlim=range(airbnb$price, finite=TRUE), main='AirBnB prices in Portland, OR')
```

. . .

Conclusion?


## Do "instant bookable" charge more?

```{r airbnb_hist2, fig.height=1.5*fig.dim, fig.width=2.5*fig.dim}
layout(1:2)
instant <- airbnb$price[airbnb$instant_bookable]
not_instant <- airbnb$price[!airbnb$instant_bookable]
hist(not_instant, breaks=40, xlab='nightly price ($)', col=grey(.8), xlim=range(airbnb$price, finite=TRUE), main='not instant bookable') 
hist(instant, breaks=40, xlab='nightly price ($)', col=grey(.8), main='instant bookable')
```

--------------

```{r airbnb_t}
(tt <- t.test(instant, not_instant))
```

## Conclusion

> Instant bookable hosts cost more than others
> (P=`r format(tt$p.value, digits=2)`, t-test with df=`r tt$parameter`).

. . .

*Critique this conclusion, and write your own.*

*Scribe:* person with the smallest `sample.int(1000, 1)`.


## Don't forget Steps 1 and 5!

1. Care, or at least think, about the data.


5. Communicate.

. . .

How *big* is the difference? How sure are we?

. . .

Statistical significance does not imply real-world significance.



## Revised conclusion (in class)

So: what did we just do?

. . .

"Hypothesis testing and $p$-values"
