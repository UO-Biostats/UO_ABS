# Hurricane lizards

##

**Data from:**
Donihue, C.M., Herrel, A., Fabre, AC. et al. [*Hurricane-induced selection on the morphology of an island lizard.*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0352-3) Nature 560, 88â€“91 (2018).

```
Anolis scriptus morphology and performance from before and after hurricanes

Lizard morphology data collected from two visits to Pine Cay and Water Cay in
the Turks and Caicos Islands. Anolis scriptus lizards were surveyed on both
islands four days before hurricane Irma and again, six weeks later, after the
islands had been hit by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. We measured morphology and
performance and found significant differences in the "before" and "after"
hurricane lizard population morphology. All linear measurements are in MM,
surface area measurements are in MM2 and force in N. Counts correspond to the
number of lamellar scales on the forelimb and hind limb toepads.

Here's the data: [../Datasets/Hurricane_lizards/](../Datasets/Hurricane_lizards/README.md).
First we'll read it in, reorder the levels of the Hurricane factor (so that "before" comes before "after"),
change units on SVL to centimeters so it's on the same scale as the other variables
(useful below),
and drop unused variables.

```{r read_data}
lizards <- read.csv(
            "../Datasets/Hurricane_lizards/lizards.csv",
            header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=TRUE)
lizards$Hurricane <- factor(lizards$Hurricane, levels=c("Before", "After"))
lizards$SVL_cm <- lizards$SVL / 10
varnames <- c("SVL_cm", "Femur", "Tibia", "Metatarsal", "LongestToe", "Humerus", 
    "Radius", "Metacarpal", "LongestFinger", "FingerCount", "ToeCount", 
    "MeanFingerArea", "MeanToeArea")
lizards <- lizards[, c(c("Hurricane", "Origin", "Sex"), varnames)]
head(lizards)
```

-----------

Here's the sample sizes:
```{r look}
with(lizards, table(Sex, Origin, Hurricane))
```

## Brainstorming

- What morphological differences do we expect
    betweeen the "before" and "after" groups of lizards?
- What visualizations can we use to look for these differences? (Sketch them.)
- What statistical analysis can we use?

```{r datahead, echo=FALSE}
head(lizards)
```

## Steps in data analysis

1. Care, or at least think, about the data.

2. Look at the data.

3. Query the data.

4. Check the results.

5. Communicate.




## Ideas

*Which variables do we expect?*
Anything that lowers the cetner of gravity might be associated. Also, big feet might be important.

1. Look at the distributions, with the pre- and post-hurricane histograms overlaid. Or, boxplots.

2. Look at measurements as a ratio of body length, since bigger bodies = bigger sails. (eg make histograms of this)

3. With  boxplots, we might do t-tests to compare before/after.


## Goals

- describe how traits differ before/after hurricanes
- account for confounding factor: overall size
- also possibly account for differences between islands and sexes

. . .

*Exercise:*
Write a possible conclusion sentence or two
(imagining what might happen).
Make sure to communicate
(a) the size of the effect we're looking for, in real-world terms;
(b) the strength of the statistical evidence; and
(c) context
(e.g., how's the size of the hurricane-induced change compare to other differences).


## Examples

We found that the typical ratio of hand size to body size was 10% larger after than before
(t-test, p-value 0.01).
This is roughly 2 standard deviations of the ratios observed within each sex;
ratios do not seem to differ between islands.

The body radius decreased by 20% after the hurricane compared to before.

Metatarsal length increased by 5% after the hurricane (possibly due to incrased grip).

We see that lizards with the longest fingers and toes (5% longer on average) survived better on average (t-test of p=0.01);
they seem to have been able to hold on better during the hurricane.




# Look at the data

## Histograms

```{r hists, warning=FALSE}
lizards_long <- pivot_longer(lizards, col=all_of(varnames), names_to="measurement")
ggplot(lizards_long) + geom_histogram(aes(x=value)) + facet_wrap(~measurement)
```

##

There is not a huge, obvious shift.
```{r next, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(lizards_long) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=measurement, y=value, col=Hurricane)) +  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) 
```

------

```{r next2, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(lizards_long) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=measurement, y=value, fill=Hurricane)) +  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) + facet_wrap(~Sex) 
```

------

Let's do some t-tests to see what happens:
```{r tt}
results <- expand.grid(
    variable=varnames,
    sex=levels(lizards$Sex),
    stringsAsFactors=FALSE
)
results$p <- NA
results$lower_CI <- NA
results$upper_CI <- NA

for (j in 1:nrow(results)) {
    v <- results$variable[j]
    s <- results$sex[j]
    x <- subset(lizards, Sex==s)
     t <- t.test(x[[v]][x$Hurricane == "Before"],
            x[[v]][x$Hurricane == "After"]
     )
     results$p[j] <- t$p.value
     results$lower_CI[j] <- t$conf.int[1]
     results$upper_CI[j] <- t$conf.int[2]
}
```

--------------

This is preliminary, but
it seems that maybe males need shorter (?) legs,
and females need larger (?) fingers.
```{r show_results}
results[order(results$p),]
```

## Everything is correlated with everything else:

```{r pairs, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3*fig.dim, fig.height=2.1*fig.dim}
pairs(lizards[,varnames], pch=20, cex=0.5,
      col=ifelse(lizards$Hurricane == "Before", "black", "red"),
      main="Before (black)/After (red)"
)
```

## sex and size are almost totally confounded

```{r pairs_sex, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3*fig.dim, fig.height=2.1*fig.dim}
pairs(lizards[,varnames], pch=20, cex=0.5,
      col=ifelse(lizards$Sex == "Male", "black", "red"),
      main="Male (black)/Female (red)"
)
```

## 
```{r pairs_origin, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3*fig.dim, fig.height=2.1*fig.dim}
pairs(lizards[,varnames], pch=20, cex=0.5,
      col=ifelse(lizards$Origin == "Pine Cay", "black", "red"),
      main="Pine Cay (black)/Water Cay (red)"
)
```

------

Let's look at the Femur ~ SVL plot:
```{r plitit, fig.height=1.8*fig.dim, fig.width=2*fig.dim}
simple_lm <- lm(Femur ~ SVL_cm + Hurricane, data=lizards)
plot(Femur ~ SVL_cm, data=lizards, col=ifelse(Hurricane=="Before", "black", "red"), pch=20)
coefs <- coef(simple_lm)
abline(coefs["(Intercept)"], coefs["SVL_cm"])
abline(coefs["(Intercept)"] + coefs["HurricaneAfter"], coefs["SVL_cm"], col='red', pch=20)
legend("bottomright", lty=1, col=c("black", "red"), legend=c("Before", "After"))
```

# Fit some models

## Today's plan

- Fit a model to only `Femur` and `MeanFingerArea`,
- check model fit, and
- summarize results.

. . .

```
Femur, MeanFingerArea ~ SVL_cm * (Hurricane + Origin)
```

Later: add `I(SVL_cm^2)`, consider other variables.

-------------

*Goal:*

> Remaining female lizards of average size on Pine Cay had an average finger
> pad area that was X% larger (95% CI of L-U%) than before the hurricane. This
> difference of X square centimeters represents roughly Y standard deviations
> of finger pad area. Similarly, males of average length ... 
>
> (same for femur length)

# IN CLASS

## What family should we use?
```{r resids, fig.width=2.5*fig.dim}
layout(1:2)
hist( resid(lm(Femur ~ SVL_cm, data=lizards)), breaks=20 )
hist( resid(lm(MeanFingerArea ~ SVL_cm, data=lizards)), breaks=20 )
```
*Note:* there are some outliers, maybe? 
We can check that later,
and if so, change the family to "student-t", maybe.

## Check scale for priors

The slope of these lines is about 4 for Femur and less than that for finger area, and the difference between them is about 0.5.
```{r plitit2, fig.height=1.8*fig.dim, fig.width=2*fig.dim, echo=FALSE}
simple_lm <- lm(MeanFingerArea ~ SVL_cm + Hurricane, data=lizards)
plot(MeanFingerArea ~ SVL_cm, data=lizards, col=ifelse(Hurricane=="Before", "black", "red"), pch=20)
coefs <- coef(simple_lm)
abline(coefs["(Intercept)"], coefs["SVL_cm"])
abline(coefs["(Intercept)"] + coefs["HurricaneAfter"], coefs["SVL_cm"], col='red', pch=20)
legend("bottomright", lty=1, col=c("black", "red"), legend=c("Before", "After"))
```

## Fit a model

```{r fitmodel}
lfit <- 
    brm(
        brmsformula(
     mvbind(Femur, MeanFingerArea) 
       ~ SVL_cm * (Hurricane + Origin) + I(SVL_cm^2)
    ) + set_rescor(TRUE),
    data=lizards,
    family=gaussian,
    prior=set_prior("normal(0, 10)", class="b"),
    file="cache/femur_finger_fit.rds"
)
```

## Check for convergence

```{r summary}
summary(lfit)
```

----

fuzzy caterpillars good!
```{r trace}
mcmc_trace(lfit)
```

-----

Hm - negative posterior correlation between slope and intercept
```{r pairs2, fig.width=3*fig.dim, fig.height=1.8*fig.dim}
mcmc_pairs(lfit, pars=c("b_Femur_Intercept", "b_Femur_SVL_cm", "b_Femur_HurricaneAfter", "b_Femur_SVL_cm:HurricaneAfter"))
````

## Look at results

```{r ceffs}
# conditional_effects(lfit)
plot(
  conditional_effects(lfit,
     effects="SVL_cm:Hurricane",
     resp="MeanFingerArea",
     conditions=data.frame(
         Origin=levels(lizards$Origin),
         cond__=levels(lizards$Origin)
     ),
     plot=FALSE),
  points=TRUE
)
```

---------

```{r ceffs2}
# conditional_effects(lfit)
plot(
  conditional_effects(lfit,
     effects="SVL_cm:Hurricane",
     resp="Femur",
     conditions=data.frame(
         Origin=levels(lizards$Origin),
         cond__=levels(lizards$Origin)
     ),
     plot=FALSE),
  points=TRUE
)
```

------

We'd like to know the propoportional increase in finger pad area
(to say "average finger pad area was X% larger after the hurricane"),
and to get a credible interval for this (i.e., for the "X% larger" part).
To do this, we'll use `posterior_epred()`, since this gets
posterior distributions of *expected values* (given the predictors).

```{r predict}
mean_female_length <- with(subset(lizards, Sex=="Female"),
                           mean(SVL_cm))
newdata <- data.frame(
    Origin="Pine Cay",
    SVL_cm=mean_female_length,
    Hurricane=levels(lizards$Hurricane)
)

pp <- posterior_epred(lfit, newdata=newdata, resp="MeanFingerArea")
# posterior distribution of the relative change
# (ie the change divided by the mean beforehand)
pp_ratio <- (pp[,2] - pp[,1])/pp[,1]
```

------------

We also want to know how the mean increase in finger pad area compares
to between-individual variation, i.e.,
the standard deviation of finger pad area for lizards
of the same length and in the same situation.
We get this using `posterior_predict( )`, since this obtains
the posterior distribution of the *response*,
i.e., of actual toe pad areas (not their mean values).

```{r predict2}
pp_values <- posterior_predict(lfit, newdata=newdata, resp="MeanFingerArea")
sd_response <- sd(pp_values[,1])
```

------

Remaining female lizards of average size on Pine Cay had an average finger pad
area that was `r round(100 * mean(pp_ratio))`% larger (95% CI of
`r sprintf("%d - %d", round(100 * quantile(pp_ratio, probs = 0.025)), round(100 * quantile(pp_ratio, probs = 0.975)))`%)
than before the hurricane. This difference of `r mean(pp[,2] - pp[,1])` square
centimeters represents roughly three-quarters of a standard deviation of finger
pad area. Similarly, males of average length ...


# Model fit

---------

No outliers in the residuals:
we're probably OK with the Normal family.
```{r pp_check}
pp_check(lfit, resp="MeanFingerArea", type='scatter')

pp_check(lfit, resp="MeanFingerArea", type='error_hist')
```
