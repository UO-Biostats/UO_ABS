# Permutation tests


## 

```{r ttest, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
airbnb <- read.csv("../Datasets/portland-airbnb-listings.csv")
airbnb$price <- as.numeric(gsub("$", "", airbnb$price, fixed=TRUE))
airbnb$instant_bookable <- (airbnb$instant_bookable == "t")
t.test(airbnb$price[airbnb$instant_bookable], airbnb$price[!airbnb$instant_bookable])
```

**But,** the $t$ test relies on *Normality*.
Is the distribution of AirBnB prices too "weird"?
How can we be sure?

. . .

Methods:

1. Remove the big values and try again.

2. Use a nonparametric test.



## The permutation test

*Observation:*
**If** there was no meaningful difference in prices between "instant bookable" and not,
**then randomly shuffling that label** won't change anything.

. . .

Strategy:

1. Shuffle the `instant_bookable` column.
2. Compute the difference in means.
3. Repeat, many times.
4. Compare: the $p$-value is the proportion of "shuffled" values more extreme than observed.

. . .

![Rightarrow](images/finger_right.png){.finger width="15%"} 
*Why* is this a $p$-value?  For what hypothesis?

## Shuffle once

```{r shuf}
fake_is_instant <- sample(airbnb$instant_bookable)
(mean(airbnb$price[fake_is_instant], na.rm=TRUE) - 
                mean(airbnb$price[!fake_is_instant], na.rm=TRUE))
```

## Many times

```{r many_shuf, cache=TRUE}
real_diff <- (mean(airbnb$price[airbnb$instant_bookable], na.rm=TRUE)
               - mean(airbnb$price[!airbnb$instant_bookable], na.rm=TRUE))
permuted_diffs <- replicate(10000, {
        fake_is_instant <- sample(airbnb$instant_bookable)
        (mean(airbnb$price[fake_is_instant], na.rm=TRUE)
             - mean(airbnb$price[!fake_is_instant], na.rm=TRUE))
   } )
hist(permuted_diffs, xlab="shuffled differences in mean", xlim=range(c(permuted_diffs, real_diff)))
abline(v=real_diff, col='red', lwd=3)
```

## How surprising was the real value?

```{r perm_p}
mean(abs(permuted_diffs) > abs(real_diff))
```

. . .

> The difference in price between instant bookable and not instant bookable
> is highly statistically significant ($p \approx 0.001$, permutation test).


## Our turn

Let's do the analogous thing for the ANOVA
comparing price between neighbourhoods:
```{r anvoa_again}
anova(lm(price ~ neighbourhood, data=airbnb))
```
