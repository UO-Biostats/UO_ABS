# Estimating means, part 2

## The problem

We are interested in estimating the average body weight
of squirrels in a nearby patch of forest
(for the purpose of comparing to other locations).
We have only weighed so far five squirrels,
whose weights, in grams, are
```
642, 687, 451, 410, 586
```

Suppose that the distribution of squirrel weights
is Normal with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.

1. Assuming that $\sigma=150$,
    choose a Normal prior for $\mu$
    and find the maximum posterior estimate for $\mu$,
    given the data.

2. Choose Normal prior distributions for $\mu$ and $\sigma$,
    and find the maximum posterior estimates for both.
