## The chi-squared distribution

Suppose that $Z_1, \ldots, Z_k$ are independent $\Normal(0, 1)$.
Then

$$ \chi^2 = Z_1^2 + \cdots + Z_k^2 $$

has the *chi squared distribution* with $k$ degrees of freedom.

. . .

*Notes:*

1. $\chi^2$ is a unitless nonnegative number.

2. $\E[\chi^2] = k$.

3. If instead $Z_i \sim \Normal(\mu_i, \sigma_i)$,
   then $\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^k (Z_i - \mu_i)^2 / \sigma_i$.

4. $\chi^2 \sim \Gam(k/2, 1/2)$.

## Asymptotics

If the number of observations in a contingency table with $r$ rows and $c$ columns is large,
then the chi-squared *statistic*
has, approximately, the chi-squared distribution with $(r-1)\times(c-1)$ degrees of freedom
under the hypothesis of independence of rows and columns.

. . .

(Asymptotically, i.e., as the number of observations goes to infinity.)
