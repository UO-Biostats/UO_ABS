**Data from:**
Donihue, C.M., Herrel, A., Fabre, AC. et al. [*Hurricane-induced selection on the morphology of an island lizard.*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0352-3

Anolis scriptus morphology and performance from before and after hurricanes

Lizard morphology data collected from two visits to Pine Cay and Water Cay in
the Turks and Caicos Islands. Anolis scriptus lizards were surveyed on both
islands four days before hurricane Irma and again, six weeks later, after the
islands had been hit by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. We measured morphology and
performance and found significant differences in the "before" and "after"
hurricane lizard population morphology. All linear measurements are in MM,
surface area measurements are in MM2 and force in N. Counts correspond to the
number of lamellar scales on the forelimb and hind limb toepads.

Here's the data: [../Datasets/Hurricane_lizards/](../Datasets/Hurricane_lizards/README.md).
First we'll read it in, reorder the levels of the Hurricane factor (so that "before" comes before "after"),
change units on SVL to centimeters so it's on the same scale as the other variables
(useful below),
and drop unused variables.

```{r read_data}
lizards <- read.csv(
            "../Datasets/Hurricane_lizards/lizards.csv",
            header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=TRUE)
lizards$Hurricane <- factor(lizards$Hurricane, levels=c("Before", "After"))
lizards$SVL_cm <- lizards$SVL / 10
varnames <- c("SVL_cm", "Femur", "Tibia", "Metatarsal", "LongestToe", "Humerus", 
    "Radius", "Metacarpal", "LongestFinger", "FingerCount", "ToeCount", 
    "MeanFingerArea", "MeanToeArea")
lizards <- lizards[, c(c("Hurricane", "Origin", "Sex"), varnames)]
head(lizards)
```

-----------

Here's the sample sizes:
```{r look}
with(lizards, table(Sex, Origin, Hurricane))
```

## Brainstorming

- What morphological differences do we expect
    betweeen the "before" and "after" groups of lizards?
- What visualizations can we use to look for these differences? (Sketch them.)
- What statistical analysis can we use?

```{r datahead, echo=FALSE}
head(lizards)
```
