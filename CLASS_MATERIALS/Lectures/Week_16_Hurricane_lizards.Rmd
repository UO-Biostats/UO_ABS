Anolis scriptus morphology and performance from before and after hurricanes

Lizard morphology data collected from two visits to Pine Cay and Water Cay in
the Turks and Caicos Islands. Anolis scriptus lizards were surveyed on both
islands four days before hurricane Irma and again, six weeks later, after the
islands had been hit by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. We measured morphology and
performance and found significant differences in the "before" and "after"
hurricane lizard population morphology. All linear measurements are in MM,
surface area measurements are in MM2 and force in N. Counts correspond to the
number of lamellar scales on the forelimb and hind limb toepads.
