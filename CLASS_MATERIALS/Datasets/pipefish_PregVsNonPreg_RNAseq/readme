Notes on Gulf pipefish male brood pouch RNA-Seq data

pipefish_RNAseq_CPM.tsv
- contains normalized RNA-Seq data (copies per million) from the brood pouch tissues of 12 adult males
- samples with “P” in name are from early-stage pregnant males; samples with “N” in name are from non-pregnant males
- only contains information for genes with reliable count data in at least some libraries
- also includes some annotation information, including KEGG orthology IDs, for genes when available
- should be clear separation between pregnant and non-pregnant males in transcriptome space
