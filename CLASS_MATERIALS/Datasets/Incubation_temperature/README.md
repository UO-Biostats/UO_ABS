# Data from Nord & Nilsson 2011, *Incubation temperature affects growth and energy metabolism in blue tit nestlings*

Measurements of several body measurements on nestlings at two ages
from various nests under three experimental treatments: eggs were
removed from nests and artificially incubated at three temperatures.

> Biometric measurements (mass, tarsus and wing length) on experimental blue
> tit nestlings at 6 and 14 days of age, collected over three years in south

*Abstract:*

>  Because the maintenance of proper developmental temperatures during avian
>  incubation is costly to parents, embryos of many species experience pronounced
>  variation in incubation temperature. However, the effects of such temperature
>  variation on nestling development remain relatively unexplored. To investigate
>  this we artificially incubated wild blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus L.) clutches
>  at 35.0 °C, 36.5 °C or 38.0 °C during two thirds of the incubation period. We
>  returned clutches to their original nests prior to hatching and subsequently
>  recorded nestling growth and resting metabolic rate. The length of the
>  incubation period decreased with temperature whereas hatching success
>  increased.. Nestlings from the lowest incubation temperature had shorter
>  tarsus length at two weeks of age, but body mass and wing length were not
>  affected by temperature. In addition, nestlings from the lowest temperature
>  had a significantly higher resting metabolic rate compared to mid and high
>  temperature nestlings, which may partly explain observed size differences
>  between groups. These findings suggest that nest microclimate can influence
>  nestling phenotype, but whether observed differences carry over to later
>  life-history stages remains unknown.
