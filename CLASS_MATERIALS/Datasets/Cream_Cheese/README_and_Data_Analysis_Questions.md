## Cream Cheese Data Analysis

The following dataset contains sensory data for a panel test of 9 cream cheeses that was part of M. B. Frøst’s dissertation at the University of Copenhagen. See the 'data dictionary' document for information on the cream cheese types and sensory scales. 

A subset of the original questions associated with this study were:

1. How are the sensory properties of cream cheese affected by changes in fat level?

2. Does the addition of a cream aroma affect other sensory properties than just aroma/flavor descriptors?


You might also be curious to use some of your multivariate methods to see how these cream cheeses fall out in flavor or smell space before starting your formal analyses (as in Bro et al., 2008).
