> See www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/ for additional details.
>  
> Data from March 1958 through April 1974 have been obtained by C. David Keeling
> of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the

> The "average" column contains the monthly mean CO2 mole fraction determined
> from daily averages.  The mole fraction of CO2, expressed as parts per million
> (ppm) is the number of molecules of CO2 in every one million molecules of dried
> air (water vapor removed).  If there are missing days concentrated either early
> or late in the month, the monthly mean is corrected to the middle of the month
> using the average seasonal cycle.  Missing months are denoted by -99.99.
> The "interpolated" column includes average values from the preceding column
> and interpolated values where data are missing.  Interpolated values are
> computed in two steps.  First, we compute for each month the average seasonal
> cycle in a 7-year window around each monthly value.  In this way the seasonal
> cycle is allowed to change slowly over time.  We then determine the "trend"
> value for each month by removing the seasonal cycle; this result is shown in
> the "trend" column.  Trend values are linearly interpolated for missing months.
> The interpolated monthly mean is then the sum of the average seasonal cycle
> value and the trend value for the missing month.
> 
> NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change, 
> depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality
> control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same
> reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.
