# Data from Donihue et al 2018, "Hurricane-induced selection on the morphology of an island lizard"

Contains survey data of about 12 morphological measurements of Anoilis scriptis lizards
from two cays in the Carribean before and after two large hurricanes.
The surviving lizards had significantly greater grip per body size.

"Usage notes", verbatim from Data Dryad:

> Anolis scriptus morphology and performance from before and after hurricanes
>
> Lizard morphology data collected from two visits to Pine Cay and Water Cay in
> the Turks and Caicos Islands. Anolis scriptus lizards were surveyed on both
> islands four days before hurricane Irma and again, six weeks later, after the
> islands had been hit by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. We measured morphology and
> performance and found significant differences in the "before" and "after"
> hurricane lizard population morphology. All linear measurements are in MM,
> surface area measurements are in MM2 and force in N. Counts correspond to the
> number of lamellar scales on the forelimb and hind limb toepads.
