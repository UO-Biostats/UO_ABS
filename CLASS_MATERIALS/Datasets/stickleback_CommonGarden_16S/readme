Notes on 60-dpf stickleback common garden experiment data

CG_OTUtable_*.tsv
- each of these files contains down-sampled OTU read counts
- counts from each library were down-sampled to 53,000 total
- OTU counts are binned by taxonomic level (these levels correspond to the 6 different files)  

CG_Metadata.tsv
- contains predictor variable information for individual libraries
- there is one “negative control” library, which involved DNA isolation from a “blank” collection tube, and the usual library construction 
- note that most samples are represented by 2 libraries, which are technical (library prep.) replicates

CG_ExpDesign.pdf
- schematic of the experimental design
- one entire Bt family had 100% mortality in both tanks

Other notes:
- it will be clear that there is very little variation between technical replicates
- preliminary analyses suggest a negative relationship between fish size and OTU richness, but only in the 2 hybrid families
- there is quite a clear tank effect with respect to beta diversity
- there is a possibility that OTUs belonging to the genus Delftia are contaminants, because they are very abundant in the negative control
