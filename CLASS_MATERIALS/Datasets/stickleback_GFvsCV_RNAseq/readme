Notes on 14-dpf gnotobiotic stickleback experiment data

CVvsGF_development.tsv
- contains proportion of abnormally and normally developed offspring per flask
- the vast majority of the "abnormally developed" fish died by 14 dpf

CVvsGF_RNAseq_CPM.tsv
- contains normalized RNA-Seq data (copies per million) for 84 experimental fish
- only contains information for genes with reliable count data in at least some libraries
- also includes annotation information for genes
- genes especially subject to sex-biased expression should be on "groupXIX" from 6-12 Mb

CVvsGF_RNAseq_Metadata.tsv
- contains factor level assignments for individual fish

stickleback_heat.tsv
- for clustering and heatmap exercise
- contains normalized expression values for a subset of LG4 and LG19 genes (with gene names)
- strong clustering by sex for LG19, but not LG4
