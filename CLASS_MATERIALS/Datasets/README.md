**On using existing datasets:**
An fun and exciting part of data analysis is *exploration*: what will we discover in the data?
It can also be frustrating, especially if you don't know what you're looking for:
have I not found X because I have a bug in my code or because it's not there?
This is one reason it's important to have the goals and questions clear,
not only for final analyses but also for the exploratory phase:
be clear what aspects of the data you want to summarize.
If you want to analyze a dataset attached to a paper,
you might feel like reading the paper first is cheating, because then you already know "what the answer is".
But, reanalyzing a dataset following along what someone else did is a *very* useful exercise,
in part because it lets you focus on the statistics separately from figuring out what the goal is.
Of course, the skill of figuring out what to look at and what questions to ask
is another very important skill to practice, but it helps to separate these when learning.
