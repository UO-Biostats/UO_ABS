<h1 id="homework-number-8-simulation-challenge">Homework number 8:
Simulation challenge</h1>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> You should analyze one of the
student-created datasets described below. As usual, your task is to use
Rmarkdown to write a short report, readable by a technically literate
person. The code you used should not be visible in the final report
(unless you have a good reason to show it). You will have time to
discuss this in groups (the same groups as before), but you should write
up the report yourself (in your own words).</p>
<p>You can use the following function to find out which dataset to
analyze, where <code>g</code> is your group number:</p>
<pre><code>f &lt;- function (g) {
    groups &lt;- c(1, 3, 4, 5, 8)
    c(groups, groups)[match(g, groups) + 3]
}</code></pre>
<p>For instance, if you are in group 3, then <code>f(3) = 8</code>, so
you should analyze the “group 8” dataset below.</p>
<p><strong>Due:</strong> Submit your work via Canvas by the end of the
day (midnight) on <strong>Tuesday, December 3rd</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="group-1-ufos">Group 1: UFOs</h2>
<p>The X-files unit of the FBI is interested in the number of recent UFO
sightings in the United States. The agents suspect that the government
is testing alien technology at military bases. To help assess this
hypothesis, they have surveyed 150 towns in America. Previous “research”
has indicated that UFO sightings are more common in rural areas, so they
chose a random 150 towns from the smallest 25% of towns in America. For
each town, they recorded the population size (in 1000s) and the distance
to the nearest military base (in miles). Their tech-savvy crew of three
nerds scoured the Internet to count up the number of UFO sightings
posted about in each town during 2020 (though they did not control for
unique UFOs or usernames). Since one of the agents thinks UFO sightings
are made up by conspiracy theorists, they have also recorded the 2020
voter turnout rate in each town.</p>
<p>The questions that the agents are interested in answering are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do towns that are closer to military bases have more UFO
sightings?</li>
<li>Do towns with lower voter turnout rates have more UFO
sightings?</li>
<li>Do these effects depend on population size?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="group-3-social-media">Group 3: Social Media</h2>
<p>We have conducted a survey on 150 students from 3 different major,
(sociology, biology, and fine arts) and asked them to record their daily
social media usage. The applicants voluntarily installed an app on their
phone to track their daily social media usage and at the end of the
month their average daily usage was recorded. We included information
about genders and range of ages (18-30) in the survey.</p>
<p>They then participated in an electronic test that measures one’s
attention span and strength of their focus through various games and
questions, and the possible scores ranged from 40 (worse attention span)
to 100 (best able to focus without distraction).</p>
<p>None of the applicants were diagnosed with any mood or attention
disorders prior to this test, and to the best of their knowledge they
were not using any medication that would effect their attention span and
ability to focus.</p>
<p>Before starting the test they were asked again if they feel ready and
comfortable to take the test, and they had the chance to opt out at any
time; the applicants were instructed not to do any heavy physical or
intellectual activity on the day of the test.</p>
<p>We want to know to what degree the demographic variables (age, gender
and major) and the number of hours spent on social media are correlated
with attention span (as measured by the test score).</p>

<h2 id="group-4">Group 4:</h2>
<p>The North Pole surveys cities every year to ask children if they have
seen reindeer flying on Christmas Eve (not really, but let’s be festive
and pretend!). The data contains survey data collected over 50 years
(from 1972 to 2021) on 5 different cities - Nuuk, Montreal,
Longyearbyen, Moscow, and Reykjavik. The “surveyed” column reports the
number of children in each city who were surveyed that year. The
“yes_reindeer” column records the number of children surveyed who
reported reindeer sightings on Christmas Eve. Note that each city varies
in terms of their distance from the North Pole - you can look at a map
to see how far they are. With the data provided, please answer the
following questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>How, if at all, is the number of children who reported reindeer
sightings influenced by location (city, and distance from the North
Pole), and year? Hint: you should account for the fact that the number
of individuals surveyed (and thus the number of “yeses” recorded) varies
by both city and year.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on your results, which cities are more/less likely to have
higher prevalence of reindeer sightings?</p></li>

<h2 id="group-5-alcohol-use-in-a-clinical-sample-of-adolescents">Group
5: Alcohol Use in a Clinical Sample of Adolescents</h2>
<p>Researchers used a cross-sectional design to examine alcohol use in a
clinical sample of adolescents. The sample consisted of 400 adolescents
receiving substance use treatment from a university-affiliated hospital
system. Data were collected by trained research assistants who conducted
clinical assessment interviews with the participants during the
treatment admission/intake process. Only those who reported at least one
binge drinking or high-intensity drinking episode within the seven days
prior to intake were eligible to participate in the study. Variables
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Drinking episode level:</strong> Binge drinking episode
(consuming 5-9 standard drinks in a row) or high-intensity drinking
episode (consuming 10+ standard drinks in a row) in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1178221818822976">past seven days</a>. If
an adolescent reported drinking episodes at both levels, the level with
greater risk (i.e., high-intensity drinking) was recorded.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Age:</strong> In years.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gender:</strong> Self-reported gender identity (girl,
boy, non-binary).</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.420">Revised Adverse
Childhood Experiences Checklist</a> score</strong>: Number of adverse
childhood experiences (ACEs; e.g., abuse, maltreatment, stressful life
events, environmental stressors), with a higher number indicating a
greater number of adverse experiences. The revised checklist consists of
14 different adverse experiences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Past 7-day cannabis use:</strong> Days of cannabis use
over the past seven days</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-7358(88)90050-5">Beck Depression
Inventory</a> score:</strong> A validated measure of depression
severity, with a total score ranging from 0-63. A higher score indicates
more severe depression. The recognized ranges are: minimal depression
(0-13), mild depression (14-19), moderate depression (20-28), and severe
depression (29-63).</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0887-6185(92)90026-4">Beck Anxiety
Inventory</a> score:</strong> A validated measure of anxiety severity,
with a total score ranging from 0-63. A higher score indicates more
severe anxiety. The recognized ranges are: minimal anxiety (0-7), mild
anxiety (8-15), moderate anxiety (16-25), and severe anxiety
(26-63).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coping motives for alcohol use score:</strong> A subscale
from the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/1040-3590.6.2.117">Drinking
Motives Questionnaire</a> measuring how often alcohol use is motivated
by decreasing stress, avoidant behavior, and alleviating negative
affect. The total score ranges from 0-20, with a higher score indicating
drinking is more often motivated by coping.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social motives for alcohol use score:</strong> A subscale
from the Drinking Motives Questionnaire measuring how often alcohol use
is motivated by drinking to improve social situations and interactions.
The total score ranges from 0-20, with a higher score indicating
drinking is more often socially motivated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Question:</em> What characteristics differentiate adolescents who
reported a high-intensity drinking episode from those who reported a
binge drinking episode?</p>

<h2 id="group-8">Group 8:</h2>
<p>The goal of this study was to explore the effects of multiple factors
on patients’ blood sugar. For this study, 100 participants ate pancakes
and drank juice as their first meal of the day. Participants were
provided with juice boxes by the study, but were given the option of
receiving pancakes from the study or bringing them homemade from home.
The participants were then asked to record the amount of pancakes (in
grams) and the amount of juice (mL) consumed. In addition, they were
asked to note whether the pancakes were homemade or provided by the
study. Finally, the participants were asked to record how much time they
had spent exercising (in minutes) earlier that day. 15 minutes after the
meal, the participants received a blood sugar test to determine their
blood sugar in mg/dL.</p>
<p>The goal of the analysis is to determine which (if any) of the
variables including pancake consumed (g), juice consumed (mL), whether
the pancakes were homemade, and time spent exercising (min)
significantly predict the blood sugar (mg/dL) of the participant</p>
