<h1 id="homework-9-youth-smoking-rates">Homework 9: Youth smoking rates</h1>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> Your task is to use Rmarkdown to write a short report, readable by a technically literate person. The code you used should not be visible in the final report (unless you have a good reason to show it).</p>
<p><strong>Due:</strong> Submit your work via Canvas by the end of the day (midnight) on Thursday, December 10th. Please submit <strong>both the Rmd file and the resulting html or pdf file.</strong> You can work with other members of class, but I expect each of you to construct and run all of the scripts yourself.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>For this assignment, you’ll be using a subset of data from the CDC National Youth Tobacco Survey: <a href="yts.csv">yts.csv</a>. These data describe the prevelence of cigarette use in middle and high school students by state or US terrritory from 2000-2017. The methodology and detailed descriptions of the data can be found <a href="https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Survey-Data/Youth-Tobacco-Survey-YTS-Glossary-and-Methodology/i6st-vu2f">here</a>. The data were in fact collected using a two-stage stratified survey design, but for the purposes of this assignment, let’s assume (somewhat unrealistically) that the data were produced by taking a random sample of all students in the state in that year. For instance, the first row is</p>
<pre><code>  YEAR   state Gender     Education Number_Yes Sample_Size
  2000 Alabama Female   High School        227         816
</code></pre>
<p>… and so assume that the CDC surveyed 816 randomly chosen female high school students in Alabama in 2000, of whom 227 reported that they currently smoke cigarettes.</p>
<p>Please write your report to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>How many surveys do we have, from what states and which years? Are there any strange or alarming features of the data?</p></li>
<li><p>How much does cigarette use differ by state, education level, gender, and year? Is there evidence of a decline (or increase) in use over time? To answer these questions, fit a binomial model with brms:</p>
<pre><code> brm(Number_Yes | trials(Sample_Size) ~ Gender + Education + YEAR + (1|state),
            data=d, family=binomial(link=&#39;logit&#39;))</code></pre>
<p>Explain the model, and use the results provide quantitative estimates of how much cigarette use differs by state, education level, gender, and year.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the fitted model to <em>predict</em> the percent of female high school students that would report cigarette use in 2019 in Utah and in New Jersey. Provide estimates of uncertainty on your prediction.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, check the quality of these estimates by out-of-sample prediction: fit your model without 2017 data and use the model to predict 2017, then report how often the observed values fall within the predicted ranges of uncertainty.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As always, please write a readable report, as might be read by someone working on youth smoking policy, for instance. Please do not include code, or (for instance) copy-paste the questions above into numbered headers.</p>
