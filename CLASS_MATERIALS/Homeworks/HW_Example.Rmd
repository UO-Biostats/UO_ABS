# Example homework: COVID prevalence

**Assignment:** Your task is to use Rmarkdown to write a short report, readable by a technically literate person.
The code you used should not be visible in the final report (unless you have a good reason to show it).


## The Problem

You are tasked with designing a COVID surveillance program
that will test randomly selected people in Eugene
to estimate the overall prevalence at the time
(i.e., the proportion of Eugene residents with detectible infections).
Testing capacity is limited,
so the main question is:
how accurately can you estimate the true prevalence with a given sample size?
Convey your results in words and graphical summaries (i.e., plots).
