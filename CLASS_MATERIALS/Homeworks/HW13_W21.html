<h1 id="homework-week-13-make-up-some-data.">Homework, week 13: Make up some data.</h1>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> I would like your group to <em>make up some data</em> - i.e., come up with a model and a story, simulate data from it, and provide the story, the data, and the question. You should submit the following things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A short document (1-2 paragraphs) describing how the data were (hypothetically) collected, and posing the problem that you would like another group to solve.</li>
<li>The dataset, as a csv file, with informative column names.</li>
<li>An R script that exactly recreates the dataset (at the top, you should use <code>set.seed( )</code> to make the randomness always the same), and fits the model you have in mind (to verify that the questions are answerable from the data provided).</li>
</ol>
<p>You do not need to simulate the data from a model we have used in class, but you should check that the model you have in mind to analyse the data does what you expect.</p>
<p>Next week, others (the “analysis” team) will get (1) and (2), but (3) is for only the instructors.</p>
<p>Here are some further requirements.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The question you pose should be solvable by <em>fitting a model</em> that we have learned in this class. There should be at least three variables in the dataset, and at least 100 observations.</li>
<li>Try to make it engaging and/or fun - silly situations are ok!</li>
<li>But, it should still be realistic. The “analysis” team will be encouraged to find any impossibilities, such as negative weights, or unrealistic measurements.</li>
<li>Also, try to keep it simple - the question should be answered by doing <em>one</em> analysis, not multiple, dependent steps.</li>
<li>To ensure that the question is answerable using the data provided (so, that there is enough data and it’s not too noisy), you should actually <em>fit</em> the model you have in mind.</li>
<li>The description should not include any statistical details (e.g., don’t say that the response is Poisson distributed or that it is a linear function of the explanatory variables).</li>
<li>Please include at least one <em>red herring</em>, such as a potentially explanatory variable that doesn’t affect the response at all or a few “extreme outlier” values (as from measurement error).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Due:</strong> Submit your work via Canvas by the end of the day (midnight) on <strong>Wednesday, January 27th</strong>. (<em>Note:</em> not on Thursday as usual!)</p>
