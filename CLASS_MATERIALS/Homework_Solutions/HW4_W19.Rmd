# Short report, week 7: sparse regression

For this report, I have written R code ([here](HW4_W19_code.R))
analyzing the "diabetes" dataset that we used in class
as an example for sparse regression.
The data file, that you will need, is found [here](data/diabetes.tab.txt).
You should take the code, run it,
and write a report summarizing the analysis.
Fitting the Stan models takes about 20 minutes on my computer;
for your convenience, if you save these two files -
[data/diabetes_crossval_fits.RData](data/diabetes_crossval_fits.RData) and [data/diabetes_big_fit.RData](data/diabetes_big_fit.RData) -
in the directory where you run the code, you won't need to re-fit these.
The report should not have R code in it:
it should be written as for for statistically literate clinicians
who had produced the data,
and are interested in the practical conclusions
(but who also want to know how the conclusions were reached).
The main task is to produce a predictive model of diabetes progression.
Most (or maybe all) of the computations you should need are done in the script,
but you may do other computations of your own if you wish.

The report should:

1. Describe the data.

2. Explain the method of analysis.

3. Communicate the final predictive model,
   including uncertainty. Make sure to say
   which variables are most important,
   and what their effects are.
