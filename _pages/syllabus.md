## Course Description:
This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the core concepts and approaches for the analysis of biological data, particularly large data sets. This is meant as a first, foundational course for graduate students. It is advanced in that we will move through the material quickly with the goal of covering all major topics in univariate data analysis, forming a foundation for subsequent learning. Students will learn to use the powerful statistical programming language R.
