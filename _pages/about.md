## Primary Instructor for Course 1 (Fall 2018)
This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the core concepts and approaches for the analysis of biological data, particularly large data sets. This is meant as a first, foundational course for graduate students. It is advanced in that we will move through the material quickly with the goal of covering all major topics in univariate data analysis, forming a foundation for subsequent learning. Students will learn to use the powerful statistical programming language R.
