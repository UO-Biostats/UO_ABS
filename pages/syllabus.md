## Description of the course

This two-quarter graduate course aims to provide students with practical
understanding of and experience with core concepts and methods in modern data
analysis. The focus is on biological data, but skills will be transferable to
other disciplines. Students will become familiar with major topics in
univariate and multivariate statistics, analysis of large data sets, and
Bayesian analysis. There is a particular emphasis on modeling and conceptual
understanding of statistical noise and uncertainty. The course is advanced in
that we will move through the material quickly with the goal of providing
a solid foundation for subsequent learning. Students will learn to use the
powerful statistical programming language [R](https://r-project.org), and the
flexible modeling package [Stan](https://mc-stan.org).

## Course Information

- *Schedule:* Tue/Thur 10:15 AM - 11:45 AM
- *Websites:* besides [the page you are looking at](https://UO-Biostats.github.io/UO_ABS/),
    assignments and announcements will be distributed on the Bi 610 [canvas page](https://canvas.uoregon.edu/)
- *Assignments:* Assigned, and due, on Thursdays.

## Textbooks

We will be assigning reading from these books:

* Quinn, G. & M. Keough. 2002. *Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists.* Cambridge Univ. Press.

* Kruschke, J. 2018. *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, 2nd ed.* Academic Press. ([website with data and code](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/))


There is a list of other useful reading materials on [the page of references](reference.html).

## Software:

* Latest version of R ([install here](https://www.r-project.org))
* A working version of [RStan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html)
* An R scripting environment such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.org),
* or a good code editor like [Atom](https://atom.io) or [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) or [vim](https://www.vim.org)
* *optional:* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (here is an [intro](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/10/27/new-zine--oh-shit--git-/))

## Prerequisites:

Students should be comfortable with algebra and the basics of calculus,
have some familiarity of introductory statistics,
and have some experience with programming.

## Class structure, remote learning, and support

It's our goal to run this class in a way that provides everyone access
in a way that feels safe, flexible, and supportive.
As of the start of the quarter,
UO requires [students and employees to be fully vaccinated](https://coronavirus.uoregon.edu/vaccine),
and [masks to be properly worn inside](https://coronavirus.uoregon.edu/prevention).
We expect everyone to follow these requirements.
We plan to teach class wearing masks,
but if you rely on lip reading to understand lectures, please let me know,
and I'll figure something out.
For more information about UO's current policy, see [this Q&A](https://provost.uoregon.edu/resource-rubric).
And, here is the UO's [COVID containment plan](https://provost.uoregon.edu/covid-containment-plan-classes) for classes.
In short, you should not come in if you have symptoms,
and if you test positive or have come in close contact with a case you should
fill out the [contact reporting form](https://oregon.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6lfKVJkE0jAGPvn).

However, there will be times when you can't or don't want to attend class in person:
for instance,
if [you have COVID syptoms](https://coronavirus.uoregon.edu/prevention#health-checks),
if you are a member of a high-risk group,
or if life intervenes in some other way.
So, we will make class available remotely as well,
by broadcasting lectures on zoom (see Canvas for the link)
and making the recordings available afterwards on Canvas.
We'll do our best to make participation possible for remote students,
and will discuss ways to facilitate this in class.
If something is not working for you, please tell us:
we are committed to making the course accessible to everyone,
and if it's a problem for you, it's almost certainly a problem for others as well.

We recognize that it is still an extremely challenging time for many people.
It certainly has been for us,
given the ongoing pandemic, failure to address systemic racism,
inaction on climate change, wildfires and other effects of climate change,
elections increasingly affected by disinformation,
and ongoing attacks on women's equality and autonomy.
However: central to many (all?) of these issues are *information*,
*science*, and *data*.
One aim of this class is to empower you to engage meaningfully:
to evaluate disparate sources of information,
and to process and communicate lessons from data for a broader audience.
That said, it is still a challenging time.
If you need flexibility on assignments or projects,
or even just someone to talk to,
please let us know.

## Assignments and evaluation

Course grades will be based entirely on assignments.
Most assignments are weekly homeworks,
assigned on Thursdays and due the following Thursday.
These will be short, readable, descriptive statistical reports,
which you will write in Rmarkdown (here are some [tips for doing this](rmarkdown_tips.html)),
and so also contain the R code that produces the analyses and figures.
Once or twice during the quarter instead of a report
we will also assign *peer reviews*,
where you review a classmate's assignment (here's [how to do this](peer_reviews.html)).
There will also be a few other types of assignment:
for instance, filling out a class survey (graded on participation only),
and (in Winter quarter) a group data analysis project.
The contribution of these to the final grade will be proportional to the points assigned,
and thresholds for letter grades will be chosen to reflect a graduate-level course:
A: good, demonstrates competance in all topics and mastery of many;
B: acceptible, demonstrates competance in all topics;
C: unsatisfactory.

## Inclusion and accessibility

Please tell us your pronouns and/or name,
especially if it differs from the class roster.
We take seriously our responsibility to create inclusive learning environments.
Please notify us if there are aspects of the instruction or design of this
course that result in barriers to your participation! You are also encouraged
to contact the Accessible Education Center in 164 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155
or uoaec@uoregon.edu.

We are committed to making our classroom an inclusive and respectful learning space.
Being respectful includes using pronouns for your classmates.
Your classmates come from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences;
please avoid assumptions or stereotypes, and aim for inclusivity.
Let us know if there are classroom dynamics that impede your (or someone elseâ€™s) full engagement. 

Please see [this page](policies.html) for more information on
campus resources, academic integrity, discrimination, and harassment (and reporting of it).
