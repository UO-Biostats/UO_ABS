## Description of the course

This two-quarter graduate course aims to provide students with an understanding
of the core concepts and approaches for the analysis of biological data,
particularly large data sets. This is meant as a first, foundational course for
graduate students. It is advanced in that we will move through the material
quickly with the goal of covering all major topics in univariate data analysis,
forming a foundation for subsequent learning. Students will learn to use the
powerful statistical programming language [R](https://r-project.org), and the
flexible modeling package [Stan](https://mc-stan.org).
