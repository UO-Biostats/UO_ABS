## Description of the course

This two-quarter graduate course aims to provide students with practical
understanding of and experience with core concepts and methods in modern data
analysis. The focus is on biological data, but skills will be transferable to
other disciplines. Students will become familiar with major topics in
univariate and multivariate statistics, analysis of large data sets, and
Bayesian analysis. There is a particular emphasis on modeling and conceptual
understanding of statistical noise and uncertainty. The course is advanced in
that we will move through the material quickly with the goal of providing
a solid foundation for subsequent learning. Students will learn to use the
powerful statistical programming language [R](https://r-project.org), and the
flexible modeling package [Stan](https://mc-stan.org). *Prerequisites:*
some (basic) programming.

## Textbooks

We will use these books in the course:

* Quinn, G. & M. Keough. 2002. *Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists.* Cambridge Univ. Press.

* Kruschke, J. 2018. *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, 2nd ed.* Academic Press. ([website with data and code](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/))


If you are looking for more reference or reading material, these are also good:

* Logan, M. 2010. *Biostatistical Design and Analysis Using R.* Wiley-Blackwell.
    A fairly comprehensive book that covers how to use R to do many of the topics in Quinn and Keough.

* Wickham, H. & G. Grolemund. 2016. *R for Data Science.* O'Reilly Publishers. (free [web version](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/))
    How to do many common data analysis tasks in R, specifically in the [tidyverse](http://www.tidyverse.org).

* Wickham, H. *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis, 2nd edition* (free [web version](https://ggplot2-book.org/) of the in-process 3rd edition)
    A more comprehensive reference to ggplot2 than the [chapter of *R for data science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html).
    Also see [the documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html).


* Wilke, Claus O. *Fundamentals of Data Visualization.*. O'Reilly Publishers. (free [web version](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/))
    How to think about visualization (with source code for plots available!).

* Haddock, S. and C. Dunn. 2011. *Practical Computing for Biologists.* Sinauer and Associates. 

## Software:

* Latest version of R ([install here](https://www.r-project.org))
* A working version of [RStan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html)
* An R scripting environment such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.org)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (here is an [intro](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/10/27/new-zine--oh-shit--git-/))
* A good code editor like [Atom](https://atom.io) or [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) or [https://www.vim.org](vim)

## Prerequisites:

None, but students should be comfortable with algebra and the basics of calculus,
and have some experience with programming.
