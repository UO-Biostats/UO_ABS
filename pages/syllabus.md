## Description of the course

This two-quarter graduate course aims to provide students with practical
understanding of and experience with core concepts and methods in modern data
analysis. The focus is on biological data, but skills will be transferable to
other disciplines. Students will become familiar with major topics in
univariate and multivariate statistics, analysis of large data sets, and
Bayesian analysis. There is a particular emphasis on modeling and conceptual
understanding of statistical noise and uncertainty. The course is advanced in
that we will move through the material quickly with the goal of providing
a solid foundation for subsequent learning. Students will learn to use the
powerful statistical programming language [R](https://r-project.org), and the
flexible modeling package [Stan](https://mc-stan.org). *Prerequisites:*
some (basic) programming.
