## Description of the course

This two-quarter graduate course aims to provide students with practical
understanding of and experience with core concepts and methods in modern data
analysis. The focus is on biological data, but skills will be transferable to
other disciplines. Students will become familiar with major topics in
univariate and multivariate statistics, analysis of large data sets, and
Bayesian analysis. There is a particular emphasis on modeling and conceptual
understanding of statistical noise and uncertainty. The course is advanced in
that we will move through the material quickly with the goal of providing
a solid foundation for subsequent learning. Students will learn to use the
powerful statistical programming language [R](https://r-project.org), and the
flexible modeling package [Stan](https://mc-stan.org). *Prerequisites:*
some (basic) programming, introductory statistics.

## Textbooks

We will be assigning reading from these books:

* Quinn, G. & M. Keough. 2002. *Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists.* Cambridge Univ. Press.

* Kruschke, J. 2018. *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, 2nd ed.* Academic Press. ([website with data and code](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/))


There is a list of other useful reading materials on [the page of references](reference.html).

## Software:

* Latest version of R ([install here](https://www.r-project.org))
* A working version of [RStan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html)
* An R scripting environment such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.org)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (here is an [intro](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/10/27/new-zine--oh-shit--git-/))
* A good code editor like [Atom](https://atom.io) or [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) or [vim](https://www.vim.org)

## Prerequisites:

Students should be comfortable with algebra and the basics of calculus,
have some familiarity of introductory statistics,
and have some experience with programming.

## Class structure, remote learning, and support

To reduce the risk of transmitting COVID, the course will be *remote*,
meaning that no physical in-person activities will be required (and indeed, none are planned).
This is too bad: it's easier to get to interact, and to know everyone if we're all in the same room.
However, this course is pretty well-suited to remote instruction,
and we don't feel like we need to compromise on the quality or content of the course.
That said, if something is not working for you, please tell us:
we are committed to making the course accessible to everyone,
and if it's a problem for you, it's almost certainly a problem for others as well.

How will this work?
Classes will happen over zoom at the regularly scheduled time.
However, we won't take attendance (just as during a regular year),
and the classes will be *recorded*, so that they will be accessible
later if you have problems with internet connectivity.
We'll split up the 90 minute class periods
into roughly equal parts lecture/discussion (with slides),
live coding/data analysis demonstration, and small group activities
(e.g., discussion or coding in pairs).
In-class discussions and activities are designed to be an important part of the class,
so we hope that you can attend:
let us know if you anticipate this being a problem.

We recognize that it is an extremely challenging time for many people.
It certainly has been for us,
given the ongoing pandemic, failure to address systemic racism,
inaction on climate change, wildfires and other effects of climate change,
an election increasingly driven by disinformation,
and ongoing attacks on women's equality and autonomy.
However: central to many (all?) of these issues are *information*,
*science*, and *data*.
One aim of this class is to empower you to engage meaningfully:
to evaluate disparate sources of information,
and to process and communicate lessons from data for a broader audience.
We hope this recognition helps you to focus on the class;
it certainly does for us.

That said, it is still a challenging time.
If you need flexibility on assignments or projects,
or even just someone to talk to,
please let us know.

## Assignments and evaluation

Course grades will be based entirely on assignments.
Most assignments are weekly homeworks,
assigned on Thursdays and due the following Thursday.
These will be short, readable, descriptive statistical reports,
which you will write in Rmarkdown (here are some [tips for doing this](rmarkdown_tips.html)),
and so also contain the R code that produces the analyses and figures.
Once or twice during the quarter instead of a report
we will also assign *peer reviews*,
where you review a classmate's assignment (here's [how to do this](peer_reviews.html)).
There will also be a few other types of assignment:
for instance, filling out a class survey (graded on participation only),
and (in Winter quarter) a group data analysis project.
The contribution of these to the final grade will be proportional to the points assigned,
and thresholds for letter grades will be chosen to reflect a graduate-level course:
A: good, demonstrates competance in all topics and mastery of many;
B: acceptible, demonstrates competance in all topics;
C: unsatisfactory.

## Inclusion and accessibility

Please tell us your preferred pronouns and/or name,
especially if it differs from the class roster.
We take seriously our responsibility to create inclusive learning environments.
Please notify us if there are aspects of the instruction or design of this
course that result in barriers to your participation! You are also encouraged
to contact the Accessible Education Center in 164 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155
or uoaec@uoregon.edu.

We are committed to making our classroom an inclusive and respectful learning space.
Being respectful includes using preferred pronouns for your classmates.
Your classmates come from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences;
please avoid assumptions or stereotypes, and aim for inclusivity.
Let us know if there are classroom dynamics that impede your (or someone elseâ€™s) full engagement. 

Please see [this page](policies.html) for more information on
campus resources, academic integrity, discrimination, and harassment (and reporting of it).
