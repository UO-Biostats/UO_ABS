The (Rmarkdown) source code for these lectures is available at [the github repository](https://github.com/UO-Biostats/UO_ABS),
or by replacing the `.slides.html` suffix with `.Rmd` in the link below;
the slides are made using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
Here are the slides from
[Fall 2021/Winter 2022](2021_schedule.html),
[Fall 2020/Winter 2021](2020_schedule.html),
[Fall 2019/Winter 2020](2019_schedule.html),
and [Fall 2018/Winter 2019](2018_schedule.html).

Unlike previous years,
this year (2022), there will *only* be a Fall term.
