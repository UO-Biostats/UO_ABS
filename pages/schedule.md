The (Rmarkdown) source code for these lectures is available at [the github repository](https://github.com/UO-Biostats/UO_ABS),
or by replacing the `.slides.html` suffix to `.Rmd` in the link below;
the slides are made using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
Here are the slides from [Fall 2018/Winter 2019](2018_schedule.html) and from [Fall 2019/Winter 2020](2019_schedule.html).
