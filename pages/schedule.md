The (Rmarkdown) source code for these lectures is available at [the github repository](https://github.com/petrelharp/UO_ABS),
or by replacing the `.slides.html` suffix to `.Rmd` in the link below;
the slides are made using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
Here are the [slides from previous years](2018_schedule.html).
