## Academic integrity

All students are expected to adhere to the University's guidelines on academic integrity as outlined in the Student Conduct Code:
[policies.uoregon.edu/vol-3-administration-student-affairs/ch-1-conduct/student-conduct-code](https://policies.uoregon.edu/vol-3-administration-student-affairs/ch-1-conduct/student-conduct-code).
Academic misconduct includes cheating
("any act of deception by which a student misrepresents or misleadingly demonstrates that the student has mastered information on an academic exercise that the student has not mastered"),
and plagiarism ("using the ideas or writings of another as one's own").
All persons involved in academic dishonesty will be disciplined in accordance with University regulations and procedures. 


## Discrimination and Harassment

**Prohibited Discrimination and Harassment:**
Any student who has experienced sexual assault, relationship violence, sex or gender-based bullying, stalking, and/or sexual harassment
may seek resources and help at [safe.uoregon.edu](https://safe.uoregon.edu).
To get help by phone, a student can also call either the UO's 24-hour hotline at 541-346-7244 (SAFE), or the non-confidential Title IX Coordinator at 541-346-8136.
From the SAFE website, students may also connect to Callisto, a confidential, third-party reporting site that is not a part of the university.

Students experiencing any other form of discrimination or harassment can find information at [respect.uoregon.edu](https://respect.uoregon.edu)
or [aaeo.uoregon.edu](https://aaeo.uoregon.edu) or contact the non-confidential AAEO office at 541-346-3123 or the Dean of Students Office at 541-346-3216 for help.
As UO policy has different reporting requirements based on the nature of the reported harassment or discrimination,
additional information about reporting requirements for discrimination or harassment unrelated to sexual assault, relationship violence, sex or gender based bullying, stalking, and/or sexual harassment is available in the [Employee Responsibilities section](https://investigations.uoregon.edu/employee-responsibilities#employee-obligations)
of the Office of Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance website.

**Reporting:**
The instructor of this class is a Student-Directed Employee.
If you disclose discriminiation or harassment to me, I will respond to you with respect and kindness. 
I will listen to you, and will be sensitive to your needs and requests. I will not judge you. I will support you. 
I will only report the information shared to the university administration when you as the student requests that the information be reported
(unless someone is in imminent risk of serious harm or is a minor).
Please note the difference between 'privacy' and 'confidentiality.'
As a Student-Directed Employee I can offer privacy because I am not required to report certain information to the university.
However, I cannot be bound by confidentiality in the same way that a counselor or attorney is.
Confidential resources such as these means that information shared is protected by federal and state laws.
Any information that I as a student-directed employee receive may still be accessed by university or court proceedings.
This means, for example, that I could still be called as a witness or required to turn over any related documents or notes that I keep. 

Please note also that I am required to report all other forms of prohibited discrimination or harassment to the university administration.
Specific details about confidentiality of information and reporting obligations of employees can be found at [titleix.uoregon.edu](https://titleix.uoregon.edu).


## GE involvement and conflict of interest

This course has a graduate student GE,
who will be involved in evaluating (grading homeworks) and instructing (office hours).
If you have any privacy, conflict of interest, or other concerns about their role,
then please contact us (the instructors) and we will address them
(for instance, by grading your work ourselves).
